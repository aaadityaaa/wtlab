<!-- In the provided example, the responsiveness is achieved through the use of relative units and a flexible grid layout. Let's break down the key aspects that make this chessboard responsive:

1. **Viewport Units (`vmin`):**
   - The `width` and `height` of the chessboard are set using viewport units (`vmin`). Viewport units are relative to the smaller of the viewport's height or width, making them suitable for creating a responsive design.

2. **CSS Grid Layout:**
   - The chessboard is created using the CSS Grid layout (`display: grid`). This allows for a flexible grid with rows and columns, and the `repeat(8, 1fr)` ensures that there are 8 equal-sized columns.

3. **Square Aspect Ratio:**
   - Each square is given a `padding-bottom` of `100%` to maintain a square aspect ratio. This ensures that each square is a perfect square regardless of the screen size.

4. **Flex Container for Centering:**
   - The `body` is set as a flex container (`display: flex`) with `justify-content` and `align-items` set to `center`. This centers the chessboard both horizontally and vertically within the viewport.

5. **Responsive Font Sizes (Optional):**
   - In a fully responsive design, you might consider using relative font sizes (e.g., `em`, `rem`) to ensure that text scales appropriately with the viewport size. In this example, there is no text, but if you add any, consider using relative font sizes.

These design choices ensure that the chessboard adapts to different screen sizes and maintains a visually appealing layout on various devices. The use of relative units and flexible layout techniques allows the content to scale based on the dimensions of the viewport. -->
